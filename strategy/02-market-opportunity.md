## **🥊 Competitive Landscape Analysis**

### **Current Market Leaders & Their Failures**

#### **1. macOS Built-in Dictation - Failing Foundation**
```
📉 DEGRADING PERFORMANCE (2024-2025):
├── Accuracy: Dropped to 80-90% vs previous 90-95%
├── Reliability: Frequent system failures requiring restarts
├── User Sentiment: "Massive accessibility issues affecting work"
├── Recognition: No longer recognizes basic commands ("slash", "numeral")
├── Speed: "Much slower than previous versions"

💰 MARKET IMPACT:
├── 50M+ macOS users affected by degradation
├── Enterprise productivity impact unmeasured but significant  
├── Creates immediate switching motivation
└── Apple unlikely to prioritize fix given other priorities
```
